### Yamb for the M5Stacks Cardputer

A cool little game to install on your cardputer <br />

*Disclaimer* : If you want the game to have dice rolling sounds and <br />
to make sounds when you unselect all the die you have to mp3 files <br />
to the sd card and name them "dice_rolling.mp3" and "magical.mp3" <br />

I recommend using these: <br />
(Shoutout to the creators of those sounds) <br />
dice sound - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/dice-142528/ <br />
magical sound - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/magical-twinkle-242245/ <br />

Choose numbers 5-9 to select with how many dice you want to play with <br />
Then functional keys are:<br />
h - help menu<br />
1-9 - to select or deselect the wanted dice<br />
p - to display the current points<br />
m - to mute the device<br />
c - to deselect all the selected die <br />
r - to reset the game<br />

This is the first version, but the firmware will be updated soon!<br />
