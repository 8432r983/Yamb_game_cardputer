A cool little game to install on your cardputer

Choose numbers 5-9 to select with how many dice you want to play
Then functional keys are:
h - help menu
1-9 - to select or deselect the wanted dice
p - to display the current points
m - to mute the device
c - to deselect all the selected die 
r - to reset the game

This is the first version, but the firmware will be updated soon!
