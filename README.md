### Yamb for the M5Stacks Cardputer

A cool little game to install on your cardputer <br />

Choose numbers 5-9 to select with how many dice you want to play with <br />
Then functional keys are:<br />
h - help menu<br />
1-9 - to select or deselect the wanted dice<br />
p - to display the current points<br />
m - to mute the device<br />
c - to deselect all the selected die <br />
r - to reset the game<br />

This is the first version, but the firmware will be updated soon!<br />
